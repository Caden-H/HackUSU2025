# HackUSU2025 - SABOTANKS - 2nd Place - [Play online](https://hack-usu-2025.vercel.app/)
### Hack USU Event 2025 | Game Dev 
#### Theme: Single-Device Local Multiplayer

### HOW TO PLAY
This game requires at least two players to play. Each requires a controller. 

The goal is to shoot the other player(s) and be the last one standing. The bullets will bounce off walls and the edges of the screen. Use the left stick to move and the right stick to aim. 
#### THE CATCH
Players control their own movement, but the direction of the attached bullet cannon is controlled by the other player.
- For example, if player 1 is controlling the movement of the blue tank, they also control the aiming of the blue canon on the opponents tank. They should use the walls and their movement to aim bullets back at the other player.
- There be a learning curve at first as your brain adapts to this unique control scheme and strategies emergy. We recommend new player play a few rounds to get the hang of it and keep focus on their own tank, focusing on movement and dodging bullets.

Use the triggers to shoot. The left trigger can charge up faster bullets with precise timing while the right can be held for a stream of small bullets.

Reset with the bottom face button (A/B).
