- Scale number of players based on connected controller count
- Clean up visuals- maybe have black background come to wall edges somehow?
- Add music/SFX
- Caden will add Particles in various places- look into pixi's ParticleContainer for this, for performance reasons.
- Better bullet images could be nice
- Come up with name- SaboTanks
- More maps would be cool

tutorial? gotta get players to look at their tank, easy to get distracted by gun lol

Bugs:
- If you bump a player in the direction that they shoot a bullet, the bullet spawns and immedietelly kills them (maybe bullets have a moment where they can't kill the player that shot them?)

Future gamemode ideas:
- Soccer


FINAL- build/host project
