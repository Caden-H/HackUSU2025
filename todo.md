Clean up visuals- maybe have black background come to wall edges somehow?
Add music/SFX
Particles in various places- look into pixi's ParticleContainer for this, for performance reasons.
Better bullet images could be nice
Come up with name
Test with more players/add a way to select number of players (rn just change numPlayers in main.ts, should work with up to 4)
More maps would be cool

tutorial? gotta get players to look at their tank, easy to get distracted by gun lol

Bugs:
- If you bump a player in the direction that they shoot a big bullet, the bullet spawn and immedietelly kills them (maybe bullets have a moment where they can't kill the player that shot them?)

Future gamemode ideas:
- Soccer


FINAL- build/host project

done:
players bounce
